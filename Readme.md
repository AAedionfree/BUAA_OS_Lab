This is the backup of my work during the Operating System lab courses. There are 6 branches: lab1 to lab6. You can checkout each branch to see every stage of the whole project. In the last branch lab6, a simple and naive shell is implemented, which is final goal of this project. 

The whole project is in fact based on the MIT JOS project, but instead of using x86 assembly language, it uses the mips assemply language. So the whole project needs the support of cross-platform compiler and can only be running on Gxemul simulator.
